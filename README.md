# Drinfeld Modules

This SageMath package provides an implementation of Drinfeld modules

To install this package, first clone this repository and then run the `make`
command (inside the repository main folder). Next, to use it in your SageMath
session you just need to type:

`sage: from drinfeld_modules import *`.

This package is still in development and some parts of the code is
based on the initial implementation of Alex Petrov located here:

`petrov/AlexPetrov-original-code-drinfeld-modular-forms.sage`.
